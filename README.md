## Logistic regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical method that is used for binary classification problems, where the outcome or target variable can have only two possible values, such as true or false, or 0 or 1. Logistic Regression models the probability of the target variable being a certain value, and makes predictions based on that probability. The model is trained using a dataset of input variables (also known as features or predictors) and corresponding target variables. The goal of training is to find the best set of parameters (coefficients) for the model, so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. The output of the logistic regression model is a probability between 0 and 1, and a threshold value is typically chosen to convert the probability to a binary prediction (for example, if the probability is greater than 0.5, the prediction is "true").
